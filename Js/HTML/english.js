  paragraph:
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines and computer programs to mimic human intelligence and perform tasks that typically require human cognitive functions. These include learning from experience, understanding language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. AI combines various fields such as computer science, mathematics, neuroscience, and linguistics to develop intelligent systems capable of adapting to different situations without explicit programming for each task.There are two main types of AI: Narrow AI, which is designed to perform a specific task such as facial recognition, virtual assistance, or language translation; and General AI, which aims to perform any intellectual task a human can do. Technologies like machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and robotics are integral parts of AI development.AI has already transformed industries such as healthcare, where it helps in diagnosing diseases and managing patient data; finance, where it detects fraud and automates trading; transportation, with self-driving cars; and education, through personalized learning systems. Voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant are examples of AI used in everyday life.Despite its benefits, AI also raises ethical concerns such as job displacement, bias in decision-making, and data privacy. Therefore, responsible AI development must include transparency, fairness, and accountability. As technology advances, AI is expected to become even more powerful, revolutionizing the way we live and interact with machines, while also posing important challenges that society must address.",
