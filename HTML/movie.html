    <h1>My Favorite Best Movie in bollywood ðŸŽ¬</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>3 Idiots</h2>
    <p>
        <li style="font-size: 18px;">The movie 3 Idiots (2009) is loosely based on Chetan Bhagatâ€™s novel Five Point
            Someone. While the core theme
            of the storyâ€”three friends<br> navigating the pressures of an intense engineering collegeâ€”comes from the
            book,
            the film takes significant creative liberties, adding new characters,<br> subplots, and messages about
            education
            and life. </li>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>12th fail </h2>
    <p>
        <li style="font-size: 18px;">12th Fail is a 2023 Bollywood film directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, based on the
            real-life story of IPS officer Manoj Kumar Sharma. The movie is inspired by <br> Anurag Pathakâ€™s book of the
            same name, which narrates Sharmaâ€™s journey from failing his 12th-grade exams to clearing the UPSC Civil
            Services Examination and becoming <br>an IPS officer.</li>
    </p>

    <h2>Chhaava </h2>
    <p>
        <li style="font-size: 18px;">"Chava" is a 2025 Indian Hindi-language historical action film directed by
            Laxman Utekar. The movie is based on the life of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, the second ruler of the
            Maratha Empire, and is an adaptation of the Marathi novel "Chhava" by Shivaji Sawant. Produced by Dinesh
            Vijan under Maddock Films, the film stars Vicky Kaushal as Sambhaji Maharaj, Rashmika Mandanna as
            Maharani Yesubai, and Akshaye Khanna as Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb</li>
    </p>

    <h2>Pathaan </h2>
    <p>
        <li style="font-size: 18px;">Pathaan is part of Yash Raj Filmsâ€™ Spy Universe (which includes Ek Tha Tiger, Tiger
            Zinda Hai, and War). The story follows Pathaan (Shah Rukh Khan), an exiled spy who is called back to action
            when a deadly terrorist group, Outfit X, led by Jim (John Abraham), threatens India with a dangerous
            biological weapon. Along the way, he teams up with Rubina (Deepika Padukone), a mysterious woman with her
            own secrets. The film is packed with high-octane action, thrilling chases, and unexpected twists.</li>
